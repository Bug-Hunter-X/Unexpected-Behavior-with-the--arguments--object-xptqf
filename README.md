# JavaScript `arguments` Object Bug

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error related to the `arguments` object in JavaScript.  The `arguments` object, while appearing array-like, is not a true array and doesn't support all array methods directly. This can cause unexpected behavior if not handled correctly.

## The Bug
The `bug.js` file contains a function that uses `console.log` to print the `arguments` object.  While it seemingly works, the issue arises when trying to use array methods on this object.

## The Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct way to handle the `arguments` object. By converting it into a true array using `Array.from()` or the spread syntax (`...`), we can utilize all array methods effectively and avoid unexpected results.
